# ft_services

What is ft_server? Please read en.subject.pdf

## RUN COMMANDS:
First you need to install ``minikube``, ``virtualbox`` and ``docker``.


You can download ``minikube`` for macOS(school21) from this [website](https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-darwin-amd64)


``minikube`` binary file should be moved to /usr/local/bin.


If you don't have permission to that directory, you can move it here to srcs, but don't forget to edit setup.sh: ``minikube`` replace to ``./srcs/minikube``.


Now you can run ``setup.sh``
